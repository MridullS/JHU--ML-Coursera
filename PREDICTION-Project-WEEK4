***INSTRUCTIONS***
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 
In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.


***Background***
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 
These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, 
to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, 
but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.


Obviously the work assigned to uis is of trying to closely estimate the rouitine of the participants as they did their respective exercises which accordingly were recorded 
in their wearable device.
Starting by cleaning the data and getting rid of unnecessary columns within the data sheet we start by permorming a Cross-Validation of 5 folds to help get the parameters 
in tune to help start practising on the training data. later on Test data split from the Training data and last but not the least with about 95% accuracy we were able to 
give a good approximation.
